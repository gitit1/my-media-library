# Epic 7: Series Management & Full Series Page

## üéØ Goal

Allow users to view, manage, and update their saved series, including watch status, subtitle status, and missing episode detection. This epic expands the Series Page UI (originally created in Epic 6) into its **full view mode**, used for day-to-day tracking and updates.

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### **Task 1 ‚Äì Display Saved Series**

-   **7.1.1** Create `GET /series` with all metadata

    -   Type (e.g., Cartoon, Drama)
-   **7.1.4** Color-code statuses in the list

---

    -   Show episode list
    -   Show watch and subtitle status
    -   Allow toggling per-episode watched / subbed
    -   Allow marking all watched

### **Task 3 ‚Äì Update Series State**

-   **7.3.1** `PATCH /series/:id` to update:
    -   Watch status
    -   Subtitle status

---

### **Task 5 ‚Äì Detect & Track Missing Data**

    -   Compare TheTVDB season/episode list to local files
-   **7.5.2** Detect subtitle status:
    -   `with`, `mixed`, or `no subs`
-   **7.5.3** Show missing indicators at series + episode level
-   **7.5.4** Integrate into dashboard + filters

## üìù Notes

-   This epic takes over **after a series has been saved** (via Epic 6 or Epic 8)
-   The Series Page UI from Epic 6 is reused and extended here with edit/refresh logic
-   Future: Series page may also show Plex sync info (Epic 10), subtitle refresh (Epic 9), and file actions (Epic 8)
